# Flocking-Simulation

This is a graphics project that uses real physics and vector forces to create a flocking simulation.
First created mesh grid for a sphere and applied textures to create a "planet."
We then began creating "bird" objects (which look like paper airplanes in this project), allowing for some rotational motion in the wings.
Each "bird" object checks the proximity of other bird objects (and obstacles like "asteroids") and moves accordingly so that birds stay
  together as a flock, but do not collide.
